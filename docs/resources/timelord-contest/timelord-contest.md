We’re holding a contest for community members! You could win a timelord for submitting a winning Chia Academy course.

We're awarding one timelord to 3 separate individuals and awarding up to 5 timelords to members of one team to the strongest community-created courses for Chia Academy. Courses should be relevant to the Chia community and blockchain and neutral to third-party projects.

1. Create a Chia Academy course in written or video form and submit it to the contest using this [format](https://docs.chia.net/academy-overview/) and this [template](https://github.com/Chia-Network/chia-docs/blob/33269c4ab9a661fbaf2a61aaa062e88639e17f8f/docs/academy/academy-intro/academy-overview.md).
