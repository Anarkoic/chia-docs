The <a href="https://www.chia.net/assets/Chia_Proof_of_Space_Construction_v1.1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chia Proof of Space Construction document</a> goes deeply into the math and implementation considerations to mitigate <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/f0ba/66072ac10d9898b8a79171ec726d45ec804b.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hellman&#x27;s Time - Memory tradeoff</a> problem. A plot is a large set of proofs of space. A harvester can harvest multiple plots on the same machine. A farmer can then control <a href="/zh/farming-on-many-machines">multiple harvesters across many machines</a> to manage the whole &quot;farm&quot;.</p><p>Farming uses substantially less electricity than Proof of Work for the same unit of security. You can learn more at <a href="https://chiapower.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">chiapower.org</a>.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-is-a-vdfproof-of-time">What is a VDF/proof of time?<a href="#what-is-a-vdfproof-of-time" class="hash-link" aria-label="What is a VDF/proof of time?的直接链接" title="What is a VDF/proof of time?的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>A VDF, also known as a proof of time, is a sequential operation that takes a prescribed amount of time to compute (and which cannot be accelerated by parallelism) and which produces an accompanying proof whose result may be quickly verified. This must be done in a group, for which Chia uses ideal class groups. You can learn about them in our <a href="https://github.com/Chia-Network/oldvdf-competition/blob/master/classgroups.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">class group document</a>. <a href="/zh/timelord-algorithm">Timelords</a> usually run three VDFs at a time for the three internal blockchains of the Chia blockchain.

TXCH is the currency symbol currently being used for testnet chias. TXCH has no value and is only used for testing purposes. Chias and testnet chias can be divided up to 12 decimal places (trillionths). The smallest unit of chia, a trillionth of a chia, is called a mojo, as a tribute to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mnet_(peer-to-peer_network)#Evil_Geniuses_for_a_Better_Tomorrow" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mojo Nation</a>, a decentralized file storage platform created in the early 2000s by Zooko Wilcox, Bram Cohen, and others.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="chia-vs-xch-vs-mojo">Chia vs XCH vs Mojo<a href="#chia-vs-xch-vs-mojo" class="hash-link" aria-label="Chia vs XCH vs Mojo的直接链接" title="Chia vs XCH vs Mojo的直接链接">​</a></h3><ul><li><strong>Chia</strong> - depending on context, this can refer to Chia Network the company, the Chia software (Chia client), or the Chia blockchain.</li><li><strong>XCH</strong> - refers to the Chia token, XCH.</li><li><strong>Mojo</strong> - a trillionth of an XCH.</li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="plotting">Plotting<a href="#plotting" class="hash-link" aria-label="Plotting的直接链接" title="Plotting的直接链接">​</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-is-k">What is k?<a href="#what-is-k" class="hash-link" aria-label="What is k?的直接链接" title="What is k?的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>&quot;k&quot; is the space parameter that controls the size of plots. It is an integer for the following equation: <code>plot_size_bytes = C1 * 2^k(k + C2)</code> where C1 is constant 1 and C2 is constant 2. In practice this means that final size is roughly <code>((2 * k) + 1) * (2 ** (k - 1)) * 0.762</code> though that constant is estimated. You can examine the <a href="https://www.chia.net/assets/Chia_Proof_of_Space_Construction_v1.1.pdf#page=15" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Space Required section</a> of the <a href="https://www.chia.net/assets/Chia_Proof_of_Space_Construction_v1.1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chia Proof of Space Construction document</a> for the calculation of how much space is required for a given k.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-big-are-plot-sizes-k">How big are plot sizes (k)?<a href="#how-big-are-plot-sizes-k" class="hash-link" aria-label="How big are plot sizes (k)?的直接链接" title="How big are plot sizes (k)?的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>You can see some example plot sizes, times to plot, and working space needed based on various k&#x27;s in these <a href="/zh/k-sizes">k size tables</a>. Current working space needed for the default plotting options of a k=32 is 239 GiB and the final file is approximately 101.4 GiB. There is small natural variation in temp space needed and the final file size of each plot. Note that 239 GiB is 256.6 GB.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-k-size-should-you-plot">What k-size should you plot?<a href="#what-k-size-should-you-plot" class="hash-link" aria-label="What k-size should you plot?的直接链接" title="What k-size should you plot?的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>The minimum plot size is k=32. There is only one reason why you might want to plot larger than k=32: to maximize the total utilization of a given drive or space. A couple of k=33 plots with a majority of k=32 plots can reduce the amount of leftover unused space on a drive.</p><p>The reason k=32 was chosen as the minimum plot size was to prevent a short-range replotting attack, which is detailed in our <a href="/zh/consensus-intro">consensus doc</a>. The gist of the attack is that if someone can create a plot in less than ~30 seconds, they could create a new plot that passes the filter for each signage point, and then delete the new plot immediately afterward.

Regular consumer NVMe SSD generally has too low of a <a href="https://www.enterprisestorageforum.com/storage-hardware/ssd-lifespan.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TBW</a> rating. One of our community members keeps this handy <a href="/zh/ssd-endurance">SSD Endurance page</a> up to date so you can compare various SSDs. You should never use your root/OS SSD to plot as it can lead to drive failure and loss of booting. You can plot directly to hard drives and get good results, especially if you plot in parallel to different drives. You can use non-root SSD over Thunderbolt 3 and migrate your plots off to whatever storage you want to keep them on long term. You could even load them on a Raspberry Pi 4 with outdated USB 2.0 drives attached and they will harvest and farm just fine. PC World offers this great <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2899351/everything-you-need-to-know-about-nvme.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">background on current storage technologies</a> but this graph gives you a quick view of why we recommend NVMe SSD:

It is the file being built into the resulting .plot file.

When phase 4 is done, if <code>-2</code> = <code>-d</code>, it will simply rename the <code>.plot.2.tmp</code> to <code>.plot</code>. If <code>-2</code> != <code>-d</code>, it will copy the file into place, then rename, and finally remove the <code>-2</code> file. The amount of writing is about 110% of the resulting <code>.plot</code> file size. It is a setup dependent option - is your setup faster at moving the compressed tables into the <code>.plot.2.tmp</code> file, and then scan through the entire file, and write table headers during phase 4 - and then copy to <code>-d</code> (<code>-2</code> = <code>-t</code>) - or is it faster to send the compressed tables directly into the <code>-d</code> (<code>-2</code> = <code>-d</code>) directory, and then in phase 4, scan through the entire file, and write table headers inside <code>-d</code> (<code>-2</code> = <code>-d</code>) thereby skipping the final copy into place.

We suggest that you disable power saving mode - especially for external drives - and try to limit other possible causes of interruptions. Plotting a k=32 could take multiple hours, depending on your hardware, so these interruptions can be painful. They are also a part of why we don&#x27;t recommend plotting plots larger than k=32 as each increment in k generally doubles the time to complete a single plot.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="do-i-have-to-be-connected-to-the-internet-or-synced-to-plot">Do I have to be connected to the internet or synced to plot?<a href="#do-i-have-to-be-connected-to-the-internet-or-synced-to-plot" class="hash-link" aria-label="Do I have to be connected to the internet or synced to plot?的直接链接" title="Do I have to be connected to the internet or synced to plot?的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>No. Plotting can be done entirely offline and needs nothing from the blockchain to complete. The only time you have to be online and synced is when you&#x27;re farming so that you receive new challenges for the next blocks and transactions to include in a transaction block if you&#x27;re lucky enough to win one of them and get the transaction fees. Note that one farmer winning is independent of other farmers winning at the same time. All farmers can &quot;win&quot; at nearly the same time.

In a decade or more, k=32 may become too small, but that&#x27;s speculative. Usually the only reason to plot larger than k=32 is to optimize using all of the space on a given drive. For example, it may make sense to have two k=33&#x27;s and the rest k=32 so that you only leave 10 GB free on a given drive.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="is-the-final-size-of-the-plotted-space-the-only-variable-in-how-often-i-can-win-block-rewards">Is the final size of the plotted space the only variable in how often I can win block rewards?<a href="#is-the-final-size-of-the-plotted-space-the-only-variable-in-how-often-i-can-win-block-rewards" class="hash-link" aria-label="Is the final size of the plotted space the only variable in how often I can win block rewards?的直接链接" title="Is the final size of the plotted space the only variable in how often I can win block rewards?的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>Yes.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-do-i-know-if-my-plots-are-ok">How do I know if my plots are OK?<a href="#how-do-i-know-if-my-plots-are-ok" class="hash-link" aria-label="How do I know if my plots are OK?的直接链接" title="How do I know if my plots are OK?的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>Run <code>chia plots check -n 30</code> to try 30 sample challenges for each plot.

If you&#x27;re still worried try <code>-n 100</code> as more random attempts will give you a more valid assessment that the plots is fine. It really is ok if your plot is within 80%-120%.

Sometimes restarting the router is also necessary.</p><p>Another option is port forwarding, where you tell your router/NAT to forward requests on port 8444 or 58444 for testnet to your machine.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="why-should-i-not-run-more-than-one-node-on-a-home-network-and-whats-this-about-upnp">Why should I not run more than one node on a home network and what&#x27;s this about UPnP?<a href="#why-should-i-not-run-more-than-one-node-on-a-home-network-and-whats-this-about-upnp" class="hash-link" aria-label="Why should I not run more than one node on a home network and what&#x27;s this about UPnP?的直接链接" title="Why should I not run more than one node on a home network and what&#x27;s this about UPnP?的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>First, running more than one node with the same private keys on your home network is wasting bandwidth by syncing two copies of the blockchain over your download link. You can get the same results by running one node and <a href="/zh/farming-on-many-machines">using multiple harvesters</a> on multiple computers. Second, if you have <a href="https://www.homenethowto.com/ports-and-nat/upnp-automatic-port-forward/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">uPnP</a> enabled on both nodes and your home router supports uPnP (and most do) it will cause both of your nodes to not sync the blockchain. You need to disable uPnP on all or all but one node behind a uPnP enabled router. The CLI command <code>chia configure --enable-upnp false</code> will turn uPnP off on a node. It requires a restart of the node to take effect. If you disable UPnP on all but one of your nodes then your local router will forward inbound 8444 traffic to the one node and the rest will now be able to connect to the network but just will not accept inbound connections from the network.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="why-does-my-node-have-no-connections-how-can-i-get-more-connections">Why does my node have no connections?

Make sure you are running the most recent version of the Chia software. Check out the <a href="/zh/installation">Installation page</a>.</p><p>Step 2. If your node has no connections, it could be one of many reasons. The most likely reason is that there are no users with space to have new connections, so you cannot connect to them. To solve this, you should try opening port 8444 on your router so other peers can connect to you. Follow the steps in the <a href="/zh/node-syncing">Node Syncing page</a>.</p><p>Port 8444 is the port through which other Chia computers can communicate with your PC. When you set up port forwarding on port 8444, the Chia software on your computer can quickly talk to other PCs, link up, and start downloading and syncing with the Chia blockchain.</p><p>The network is undergoing rapid growth and expansion. Many of the newly arrived Chia peers (computers) do not open up port 8444. It makes it very hard for the network. So please port forward on port 8444!</p><p>Use this link to check if your router&#x27;s port 8444 is closed: <a href="https://portchecker.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://portchecker.co/</a></p><p>Step 3: You might need to disable UPnP in the config file (~/.chia/mainnet/config/config.yaml) or by using the cli command <code>chia configure -upnp false</code>. You might have multiple nodes running on the same machine, or in the same wifi network. Make sure to close all Chia applications on your computer. Also check your firewall or antivirus software, which might be blocking connections.</p><p>Step 4: Try deleting your peer DB which is located at <code>~/.chia/mainnet/db/peer_table_node.sqlite</code>. Close then restart Chia.</p><p>Step 5: Edit <code>~/.chia/mainnet/config/config.yaml</code>, search for <code>weight_proof_timeout</code> and increase it from 180 to 400. If that value is not there, you can add it under the <code>full_node</code> section.</p><p>It can take a few minutes to start receiving peers and several hours to completely sync.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="i-am-seeing-blocks-and-connections-but-my-node-says-not-synced">I am seeing blocks and connections but my node says &quot;Not Synced&quot;<a href="#i-am-seeing-blocks-and-connections-but-my-node-says-not-synced" class="hash-link" aria-label="I am seeing blocks and connections but my node says &quot;Not Synced&quot;的直接链接" title="I am seeing blocks and connections but my node says &quot;Not Synced&quot;的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>This is usually a system clock issue, which is causing the display of &quot;Not synced&quot;, even though you are.

The new database is still written in SQLite, but it has undergone a series of optimizations, such as storing hashes in binary, rather than human-readable hex format. It also is more compressed than version 1. These two factors combined have resulted in an approximately 45% reduction in the size of the database, as well as a slight improvement in its performance.</p><p>If you install a brand new full node in Chia 1.3 or later, version 2 of the database will be created when you run <code>chia init</code>. If you want to stick with version 1, simply run <code>chia init --v1-db</code> instead.</p><p>If you were already were running a full node prior to upgrading to Chia 1.3, the upgrade will not happen automatically. The command to perform the upgrade is <code>chia db upgrade</code>. This is documented in detail in our <a href="/zh/cli">CLI reference</a>.</p><p>You do not need to stop Chia in order to perform the upgrade. This is because the program performing the upgrade only needs to <em>read</em> from your original database file, while your upgraded file will be written alongside it in the same folder. Be sure you have enough free space on the disk that contains your database file to write the new file.</p><p>The current size requirement (2nd quarter 2022) is around 55 GB. <em>Note that the database is always growing, so the size requirement for the v2 database will have gone up by the time you are reading this — plan accordingly.</em></p><p>The upgrade could take several hours, so feel free to perform it at your leisure. After the upgrade has completed, run <code>chia start farmer -r</code> to restart your farmer and switch to the new database.</p><p>Note that the new database will have the same peak as version 1 at the time you <em>initiated</em> the upgrade. Your node will still need to run a short sync to fetch the remaining blocks that had gotten added while the upgrade was being performed.</p><p>Because the upgrade from version 1 to 2 of the database is time-consuming, most users will likely only perform it on one of their systems and copy the new database file to their other systems afterward. If you choose this option, be sure to either copy the file <em>before</em> running <code>chia start farmer -r</code>, or stop Chia altogether if it is already using the new database. Once the database is swapped from v1 to v2, you also need to update you <code>config.yaml</code> to reflect the new v2 database change.

The settings menu will appear. Click the desired mode.</p><p>Note that in both modes, the light wallet protocol is always used. This protocol will sync your wallet by only downloading information from a subset of the blocks. The more transactions your wallet has had, the longer this process will require.</p><p>The following are situations when your wallet will NOT connect to external peers:</p><ul><li><code>connect_to_unknown_peers = false</code> is set in config.yaml, under <code>wallet:</code>.</li><li>Your wallet is connected to a trusted node (typically this is your local host) AND that node is fully synced.</li></ul><p>For example, let&#x27;s say you&#x27;re running Chia for the first time and you have not modified <code>connect_to_unknown_peers</code>. Here is one potential workflow:</p><ol><li>Start the GUI and select Wallet Mode.</li><li>Your wallet will sync by downloading relevant information from external peers.</li><li>Change to Farmer Mode.

For technical info, see <a href="/zh/light-clients">our docs site</a>, as well as the <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/226.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FlyClient White Paper</a>, which details the process from which Chia&#x27;s light client is based.</p><p>First, a bit about addresses in Chia. A single Chia wallet can use up to four billion (2^32) addresses. Hopefully, you won&#x27;t need more than that! Using multiple addresses can help provide anonymity. Rather than having to sign up for a new account each time you want to receive money, you can simply click &quot;NEW ADDRESS&quot; and <em>presto</em> -- a new address appears. Additionally, each time you receive change from sending money, a new address is automatically generated. Your wallet keeps track of each of the addresses that have been used. As long as your wallet is synced, it always knows how much money you have.</p><p>One important thing to remember is that your wallet addresses will always be generated <em>in the same order</em>. When you generate a &quot;new&quot; address, you&#x27;re actually calculating the <em>next</em> address in the sequence. Your wallet doesn&#x27;t know what the next address will be until it&#x27;s generated, but the sequence will always be the same. For example, if you generate 50 new addresses (and write them down), and then install Chia on a new computer and import the same wallet, the first 50 addresses you generate will <em>exactly</em> match those from your original computer.</p><p>Next, we&#x27;ll introduce a setting called <code>initial_num_public_keys</code>. This setting is part of <code>config.yaml</code>, located in <code>~/.chia/mainnet/config</code> on Linux and MacOS, and <code>C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\.chia\mainnet\config</code> on Windows. The default value of this setting is 100. The majority of users should <em>not</em> change it.</p><p>You can think of <code>initial_num_public_keys</code> as the number of future addresses to examine. It&#x27;s a window that expands with time (and never contracts). Here&#x27;s how it works:</p><p>The first time you run Chia&#x27;s software, your wallet will attempt to sync. It does this by checking the first address in the sequence. If that address has ever received money, your wallet will account for that transaction history and examine the next address, and so on. It would take a <em>very</em> long time to examine all four billion addresses, so your wallet will stop looking at some point. This is where <code>initial_num_public_keys</code> comes in.</p><p>By default, your wallet will stop after it has examined 100 straight addresses that have never received money. If it examines 50 empty addresses and then finds a transaction on the 51st address, the number left to examine is reset back to 100. Because the addresses always appear in the same sequence, it will be rare to have even a single address without any transaction history. But there is one exception: if you click &quot;NEW ADDRESS&quot; twice, then one address will remain unused. If you click &quot;NEW ADDRESS&quot; 101 times without receiving money at any of those addresses, then you&#x27;ll have 100 consecutive unused addresses in the sequence. Let&#x27;s say you receive money at the 101st address. When your wallet attempts to sync, it will stop looking after the 100th blank address. Transactions from subsequent addresses will remain undiscovered, and your balance will be incorrect.</p><p>The default setting for <code>initial_num_public_keys</code> is quite conservative -- it should be rare for anyone to click &quot;NEW ADDRESS&quot; more than 100 times without actually using any of those addresses. That said, you might have a legitimate reason to do this, for example if you&#x27;re running an exchange. In that case, feel free to set <code>initial_num_public_keys</code> to a higher number, stop your wallet, delete your wallet database, and start your wallet again to begin a fresh sync.</p><p>Why not set <code>initial_num_public_keys</code> to a higher number by default? Because it would take longer for your wallet to sync. Why not set it lower? If the default setting were 2, most wallets would likely still show the correct balance and the sync time would be faster. However, we set the default to 100 to prioritize showing the correct balance over syncing as fast as possible.</p><p>How does your wallet know it has the correct info for each address? It polls one or more of its peers. These peers can be either trusted or untrusted, as explained in the <a href="#what-are-trusted-peers-and-how-do-i-add-them">previous question</a>. By default, your own node is the only one you trust. If your node is fully synced, then your wallet only needs to query your node to determine your transaction history for each address. If your node is not fully synced, then your wallet will query a number of peers about this info. If any of them lie, omit info, or disconnect in the middle of a query, your wallet will know because the responses won&#x27;t all match.</p><p>If you believe your balance is incorrect, changing <code>initial_num_public_keys</code> is unlikely to fix the problem. If at all possible, you should sync a full node, stop Chia, delete your wallet database, and start Chia again. This time, Chia will sync based on your own node alone. If this is not an option, then resyncing from untrustred nodes might fix the problem as well.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="farming">Farming<a href="#farming" class="hash-link" aria-label="Farming的直接链接" title="Farming的直接链接">​</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-do-i-tell-if-im-farming-correctly">How do I tell if I&#x27;m farming correctly?<a href="#how-do-i-tell-if-im-farming-correctly" class="hash-link" aria-label="How do I tell if I&#x27;m farming correctly?的直接链接" title="How do I tell if I&#x27;m farming correctly?的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>If you see plots in the Plots section of the Farm page in the GUI - your plots are being farmed.

If the plot filter bits start with 9 zeroes, that plot passes the filter for that signage point, and can proceed. This disqualifies around 511/512 of all proofs of space on the network, for each signage point. There are 4608 <!-- -->*<!-- --> 2 or 9216 signage points per day so the average plot should pass the filter 18 times per 24 hours on average. Once a plot passes the plot filter it then competes for the best proof of space with every other plot that also passed that plot filter for that signage point. For reasons that aren&#x27;t super simple to intuit, the only thing each plot is competing on is to have the best proof of space and thus the chances of getting a reward depend on total size of plots on the farm - even with the plot filter in place.</p><p>As long as the plot passes the filter, and do not have any internal file errors, the plot will always be eligible to compete for the best proof of space. Moving the plot to another directory or server will not change its eligibility.</p><p>Please note that the speed of your lookups when passing the plot filter should be below 5 and preferably below 2 seconds. When you actually win a reward, your drive will have to do more lookups than these, so it&#x27;s important that the the lookups are happening fast.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="can-i-join-a-farming-pool">Can I join a farming pool?<a href="#can-i-join-a-farming-pool" class="hash-link" aria-label="Can I join a farming pool?的直接链接" title="Can I join a farming pool?的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>Yes you can.

Even in the presence of bit flips due to aging hardware, plots remain mostly effective. The only cases where you would need to re-plot are: 1. if you are using solo plots (not NFT plots) and wish to join a pool (please see note below) or 2. if hardware speeds advance to the point of a certain k value becoming obsolete (e.g., <code>k=32</code> becomes too fast to plot and we ban them, forcing you to replace them with <code>k≧33</code> plots). For case 1., you are free to have any mix of solo plots and pool plots if you do not want to re-plot. For case 2., <code>k=32</code> is not expected to become outdated until sometime between 2026-2031.</p><ul><li>Note on case 1:
We have added a Pooling Protocol that replaces the hard-coded &quot;Pool Public Key&quot; of a plot, with a plotNFT&#x27;s &quot;Pool Contract Address&quot; - more on this subject can be read here: <a href="https://github.com/Chia-Network/chia-blockchain/wiki/Pooling-FAQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/Chia-Network/chia-blockchain/wiki/Pooling-FAQ</a></li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="is-it-possible-to-have-a-proof-but-not-get-a-reward">Is it possible to have a proof but not get a reward?<a href="#is-it-possible-to-have-a-proof-but-not-get-a-reward" class="hash-link" aria-label="Is it possible to have a proof but not get a reward?的直接链接" title="Is it possible to have a proof but not get a reward?的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>It is unlikely, but it is possible. There are multiple reasons why this might be the case. The most common is that due to network delay, or drive speed delay (for example using a slow NAS), you missed the time for inclusion into the blockchain, which is 28 seconds. This time is from when the timelords create the signage points, to when the timelords infuse your block. Check to make sure that you are connected and synced to multiple peers, and that your quality lookup are fast (&lt;2 seconds, definitely less than 5). Another reason might be that the signage point where you won did not get included into the blockchain. This can sometimes happen, since timelords may publish signage points that don&#x27;t end up on chain.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="wallet">Wallet<a href="#wallet" class="hash-link" aria-label="Wallet的直接链接" title="Wallet的直接链接">​</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-do-i-send-or-receive-a-transaction">How do I send or receive a transaction?<a href="#how-do-i-send-or-receive-a-transaction" class="hash-link" aria-label="How do I send or receive a transaction?的直接链接" title="How do I send or receive a transaction?的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>The Wallets page in the GUI will display your receive address and provide an interface for you to spend your chia funds.

Your wallet keeps track of a set of coins, where each coin can be any amount of XCH. When spending a coin (making a transaction), you have to spend the entire amount, and split that coin into multiple outputs, called coin additions. One addition is to the recipient of the transaction, and the other one is to you, as change. The change usually goes to a new address, so you will not see it in your normal address on Chia explorer, but your wallet will keep track of it and include it in the balance. Each block in Chia is a list of removals (coins spent) and additions (coins created). There are no transactions in the blockchain, which is why you cannot lookup transactions in the block explorers.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-are-hd-keys">What are HD Keys?<a href="#what-are-hd-keys" class="hash-link" aria-label="What are HD Keys?的直接链接" title="What are HD Keys?的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>HD or Hierarchical Deterministic keys are a type of public key/private key scheme where one private key can have a nearly infinite number of different public keys (and therefor wallet receive addresses) that will all ultimately come back to and be spendable by a single private key.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-many-confirmations-do-i-need-to-trust-that-a-chia-transaction-is-final">How many confirmations do I need to trust that a chia transaction is final?<a href="#how-many-confirmations-do-i-need-to-trust-that-a-chia-transaction-is-final" class="hash-link" aria-label="How many confirmations do I need to trust that a chia transaction is final?的直接链接" title="How many confirmations do I need to trust that a chia transaction is final?的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>Small reorgs in Chia are possible, though rare.

There are only conditions to make a coin that may be spent <em>after</em> a certain timestamp or block height. Coin spends can only become valid; they can never become invalid.</p><p>There are at least 4 reasons for this:</p><ol><li><p><strong>To keep CLVM separate from the mempool</strong> -- When a block is farmed, the local node executes the CLVM from all of the coin spends in that block. The mempool only contains the output of this execution. Thus, the CLVM code execution is kept separate from the mempool, and the CLVM does not need to examine the blockchain&#x27;s state in order to execute. If coin spends could become invalid, then the CLVM would need to examine the blockchain&#x27;s state, which would require special handling in the mempool (and possibly cause other problems).</p></li><li><p><strong>To preserve mempool efficiency</strong> -- If a coin spend depended on determining the timestamp or height of the last confirmed block, as would be required if coin spends could become invalid with time, then the output of the CLVM from this spend would need to be executed with each block, in order to determine if it is still valid. If the mempool became full of such transactions, then the entire mempool would need to be re-calculated with each block. This would be extremely inefficient and a potential attack vector.</p></li></ol><p>As it stands with CLVM&#x27;s implementation, coin spends only need to be executed once. The mempool can safely assume that the spend has not become invalid simply because time has passed, so there is no need to re-execute the code.</p><ol start="3"><li><strong>To keep reorg logic simple</strong> -- Small reorgs are rare in Chia, but still possible. If coin spends could become invalid with time, then they also could become invalid in a reorg. Any coin spends that depended on the original would then be invalidated. Sorting through the ripple effects of this behavior would require messy logic that would invalidate other spends, potentially even if they were only distantly related to the original.</li></ol><p>Note that this problem doesn&#x27;t exist when coin spends can only become <em>valid</em> with time. In a reorg, an invalid spend could become valid; any resulting coin spends would also remain valid. As a result, there would be nothing to unwind.</p><ol start="4"><li><strong>To prevent censorship</strong> -- If someone attempts to spend a coin that is about to be made invalid, the farmer of the next transaction block could refuse to include that coin spend, thus making the coin unspendable <em>forever</em>. This is a slippery slope -- any coin spend that will become invalid in the future could be censored until the final valid timestamp or block has been reached. The only way to guarantee that such a coin is spendable would be for the owner to farm the block in which it is spent.</li></ol><p>A related problem would occur if the coin spend didn&#x27;t add a large enough fee to be included in the next block. This could be avoided by adding a larger fee, but the problem that a valid coin spend could become invalid still would exist.</p><p><strong>Recommended Solution</strong></p><p>Because of the problems listed above, any solutions to making a coin spendable <em>until</em> a certain timestamp or block height would need to come from outside the core CLVM implementation.</p><p>Our current recommendation: First, create <code>Coin A</code>, which will run a <code>CREATE_COIN_ANNOUNCEMENT</code> condition when it is spent. Next, create <code>Coin B</code>, which uses the <code>ASSERT_COIN_ANNOUNCEMENT</code> condition for <code>Coin A</code>&#x27;s announcementID. A spend of <code>Coin A</code> will automatically invalidate any attempts to spend <code>Coin B</code> forever.</p><p>A similar (but slightly more complex technique) would be to use a singleton instead of a standard coin. Updating the singleton automatically would invalidate a coin spend, and the singleton could be reused to invalidate future spends. This technique could also be used to invalidate offers.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="where-is-the-executable-file-to-start-the-reference-wallet-gui-located-on-windows">Where is the executable file to start the reference wallet GUI located on Windows?<a href="#where-is-the-executable-file-to-start-the-reference-wallet-gui-located-on-windows" class="hash-link" aria-label="Where is the executable file to start the reference wallet GUI located on Windows?的直接链接" title="Where is the executable file to start the reference wallet GUI located on Windows?的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>If you only installed Chia for the current user, the exe will be installed to the following location (be sure to replace <code>&lt;user ID&gt;</code> with your actual user ID):</p><div class="codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#383a42;--prism-background-color:#fafafa"><div class="codeBlockContent_biex"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-text codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#383a42;font-weight:bold"><span class="token plain">C:\Users\&lt;user ID&gt;\AppData\Local\Programs\Chia\Chia.exe</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup__atx"><button type="button" aria-label="复制代码到剪贴板" title="复制" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_eSgA" aria-hidden="true"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonIcon_y97N"><path fill="currentColor" d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LjdS"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div><p>If you installed Chia for all users, then this is the location of the exe:</p><div class="codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#383a42;--prism-background-color:#fafafa"><div class="codeBlockContent_biex"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-text codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#383a42;font-weight:bold"><span class="token plain">C:\Program Files\Chia\Chia.exe</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup__atx"><button type="button" aria-label="复制代码到剪贴板" title="复制" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_eSgA" aria-hidden="true"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonIcon_y97N"><path fill="currentColor" d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LjdS"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-is-the-dust-filter">What is the dust filter?<a href="#what-is-the-dust-filter" class="hash-link" aria-label="What is the dust filter?的直接链接" title="What is the dust filter?的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>In crypto parlance, &quot;dust&quot; refers to coins that have almost no value. In Chia, the smallest denomination is 1 mojo, or 1-trillionth of an XCH. Unsolicited coins of this value certainly count as dust, but even much larger coins, for example 1 million mojos, are still worth a fraction of a penny.</p><p>Chia experienced its first &quot;dust storm&quot; in late 2021. The &quot;duster&quot; spammed the blockchain with millions of tiny coins, likely in an attempt to stress-test the network. Chia&#x27;s blockchain is robust, so it continued without issue. However, many people ended up with thousands of dust coins in their wallets. This proved problematic.</p><p>In version 1.2.x, wallets that had received tens of thousands of dust coins were unable to sync. The task of optimizing our wallet was a difficult one, but by version 1.3 we had made significant improvements, and these wallets could finally sync.</p><p>However, sync times for dusted wallets were still measured in days, which was unacceptable. We continued making optimizations, and by version 1.5.1, a wallet with over 100,000 coins could sync within a few minutes. But we wanted to reduce those sync times even more.</p><p>The dust filter is a new feature, added in version 1.6.0. It is activated whenever there are at least a certain number of unspent dust coins in the wallet. While activated, the filter ignores any coins considered &quot;dust&quot;.</p><p>Two new settings have been added to <code>~/.chia/mainnet/config/config.yaml</code> in the <code>wallet</code> section:</p><ul><li><code>spam_filter_after_n_txs: 200</code></li><li><code>xch_spam_amount: 1000000</code></li></ul><p>If you are upgrading an existing Chia installation, these settings won&#x27;t be added automatically. In this case, you will need to either add them manually or delete <code>config.yaml</code> and run <code>chia init</code> to generate a new copy.</p><p>The default settings essentially say, &quot;If my wallet contains more than 200 coins, ignore all coins after the first 200 that are worth less than 1 million mojos.&quot; Note that the filter is not applied for CATs or NFTs.</p><p>You can modify these default values to support different functionality. For example:</p><ul><li>Disable the filter by setting <code>xch_spam_amount</code> to <code>0</code> (nothing is dust)</li><li>Enable the filter regardless of your wallet&#x27;s status by setting <code>spam_filter_after_n_txs</code> to <code>0</code></li><li>Consider coins to be &quot;dust&quot; only if they are smaller than 100 mojos by setting <code>xch_spam_amount</code> to <code>100</code></li></ul><p>However, we believe the default settings will be sufficient for most users.</p><p>Note that if the number of unspent coins in your wallet falls to 200 (by default) or lower, then the dust filter will be deactivated. This could happen if you spend or consolidate some of your coins.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="why-is-my-wallets-balance-inconsistent">Why is my wallet&#x27;s balance inconsistent?<a href="#why-is-my-wallets-balance-inconsistent" class="hash-link" aria-label="Why is my wallet&#x27;s balance inconsistent?的直接链接" title="Why is my wallet&#x27;s balance inconsistent?的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>If you have more than two hundred unspent coins (by default) in your wallet, the dust filter will be activated. Depending on which mode your wallet is using, your balance could show slight differences each time you sync. This is because the coins will not necessarily show up in the same order while syncing.</p><p>The maximum difference in your balance is <code>spam_filter_after_n_txs * xch_spam_amount</code>. However, the actual difference will rarely be more than a few thousand mojos.</p><p>There are three potential scenarios:</p><ol><li><p>Light wallet only (untrusted mode) -- Your wallet is syncing from multiple remote full nodes. Each time your wallet syncs, it will connect to a new set of nodes, so the coins might not show up in the same order. Different coins could be filtered, so your balance may be slightly different each time you sync.</p></li><li><p>Synced full node (trusted mode) on multiple computers -- If you load the same wallet on different full nodes, the databases will be slightly different due to network latency. Even though the coins themselves all exist, they might not show up in the same order, so different coins could be filtered. In this case, your balance might be slightly different between the two computers.</p></li><li><p>Synced full node (trusted mode) with one computer -- Your trusted database will be the same each time you sync, so the wallet balance will also be the same.</p></li></ol><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="why-does-my-wallet-say-error-cant-send-more-than-xxxxxxxx-mojos-in-a-single-transaction">Why does my wallet say <code>Error Can&#x27;t send more than xxxxxxxx mojos in a single transaction</code>?<a href="#why-does-my-wallet-say-error-cant-send-more-than-xxxxxxxx-mojos-in-a-single-transaction" class="hash-link" aria-label="why-does-my-wallet-say-error-cant-send-more-than-xxxxxxxx-mojos-in-a-single-transaction的直接链接" title="why-does-my-wallet-say-error-cant-send-more-than-xxxxxxxx-mojos-in-a-single-transaction的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>This error can occur when attempting to send XCH, CATs, or NFTs. Unfortunately, the error is vague, so there is a bit of guesswork in determining the cause. In the future, we plan to make this error -- along with the recommended way to fix it -- more specific.</p><p>Some of the potential causes include:</p><ol><li>You don&#x27;t have enough money in your wallet. Double check your wallet&#x27;s <code>Total Balance</code>.</li><li>You have enough money, but one or more of your coins are locked. Chia uses the <a href="#what-is-the-coin-model">coin set model</a> of accounting, where everything is a coin. If some of your coins are part of either a pending transaction or an <a href="#offers">Offer</a>, they have been temporarily locked. In this case, your <code>Spendable Balance</code> is less than your <code>Total Balance</code>. In order to unlock these coins, cancel any pending offers and click <code>Actions</code> --&gt; <code>Delete Unconfirmed Transactions</code> in your wallet&#x27;s <code>Summary</code> panel.</li><li>The CLVM cost of your transaction is greater than the maximum cost allowed. In order to add a Chia transaction to the blockchain, a certain amount of processing power is required. This is the transaction&#x27;s <em>cost</em>. When sending a single coin or NFT to another wallet, the cost is low. However, if you are attempting to send hundreds of coins or dozens of NFTs in a single transaction, the total cost could be prohibitively high, thus triggering the error. One way to fix this is to break your large transaction into multiple smaller ones -- try sending only the amount indicated in the error message. Another fix is to <a href="/zh/wallet-cli#combine">combine your coins</a> by opening a command prompt or terminal window and running <code>chia wallet coins combine</code>.</li></ol><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="is-there-an-rpc-to-list-wallet-names">Is there an RPC to list wallet names?<a href="#is-there-an-rpc-to-list-wallet-names" class="hash-link" aria-label="Is there an RPC to list wallet names?的直接链接" title="Is there an RPC to list wallet names?的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>Unfortunately, no.

For example, block explorers cannot associate multiple addresses with the same wallet.

Any time you want to buy or sell an NFT, you will create or accept an Offer. Royalties are built into the NFT, so they will automatically be accounted for when the offer is created/accepted.</p><p>A transfer is where you move an NFT from one address to another. No money is exchanged, and there are no royalties. The two main use cases for transferring an NFT are</p><ul><li>Moving an NFT to another wallet that you own</li><li>Giving an NFT away for free</li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="do-i-need-a-new-wallet-address-in-order-to-receive-nfts">Do I need a new wallet address in order to receive NFTs?<a href="#do-i-need-a-new-wallet-address-in-order-to-receive-nfts" class="hash-link" aria-label="Do I need a new wallet address in order to receive NFTs?的直接链接" title="Do I need a new wallet address in order to receive NFTs?的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>No. You can send and receive NFTs from the same address you have used in the past. One caveat is that if you send an NFT to an address that is currently running on a pre-1.4 wallet, your wallet won&#x27;t <em>recognize</em> the NFT. However, the NFT will be safely kept inside your wallet, and it will become accessible after you upgrade to version 1.4 or greater.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-do-i-mint-an-nft">How do I mint an NFT?<a href="#how-do-i-mint-an-nft" class="hash-link" aria-label="How do I mint an NFT?的直接链接" title="How do I mint an NFT?的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>If you are comfortable using a command line interface (CLI), then you can follow our <a href="/zh/guides/nft-intro">dev guide</a> to mint an NFT. If you prefer a browser-based minting tool, options include <a href="https://mintgarden.io/mint" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MintGarden</a> and <a href="https://github.com/OmakaseaNFT/chia-nft-util" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Omakasea ChiaNFT</a>.

If you use the CLI command, the comma will be interpreted as a delimiter -- two separate URLs will be created. However, even though URLs that include commas are generally not recommended, they should work with the RPC command. You don&#x27;t even need to escape the comma or use extra quotes. But, as with all things NFT-related, you should test this functionality on the testnet before attempting it on mainnet.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-does-it-mean-to-self-custody-an-nft">What does it mean to self-custody an NFT?<a href="#what-does-it-mean-to-self-custody-an-nft" class="hash-link" aria-label="What does it mean to self-custody an NFT?的直接链接" title="What does it mean to self-custody an NFT?的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>On other blockchains, NFTs are typically custodied in a marketplace. This is akin to having an account with a company. The marketplace has a reputational motivation to keep your NFT safe and secure, but your NFT is still in their hands.</p><p><em>Self custody</em> means that you have control over your own assets. The same mantra of &quot;Not your keys, not your coins&quot; also applies to NFTs. When you self-custody your Chia NFTs, it means that they are controlled by <em>your</em> keys, and therefore they are <em>your</em> assets.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="where-does-my-nft-live">Where does my NFT live?<a href="#where-does-my-nft-live" class="hash-link" aria-label="Where does my NFT live?的直接链接" title="Where does my NFT live?的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>There are two components of a Chia NFT: on-chain and off-chain.</p><p><strong>On-Chain:</strong> An NFT is a special type of coin called a &quot;singleton&quot;. It contains three lists of URIs, which link to:</p><ol><li>The NFT&#x27;s data. This is typically an image file.</li><li>The NFT&#x27;s metadata. This is typically a JSON file containing information about the NFT.</li><li>The NFT&#x27;s license. This is typically a text file the spells out what rights the NFT&#x27;s owner has.</li></ol><p>The URI lists can only be prepended to; existing URIs cannot be modified or deleted.</p><p>For security purposes, each NFT contains a hash of the data represented by each of the corresponding URIs. The hashes can never be modified after minting.</p><p><strong>Off-Chain:</strong> The actual NFT image lives in at least one location online. It can be stored under any number of URI protocols, including (but not limited to) http, https, ftp and ipfs.</p><p>Because Chia NFTs use a <em>list</em> of URIs (as opposed to a single one), the image can be stored in multiple locations. This is important for preserving an NFT&#x27;s permanence because a single link could break.</p><p>For high-end NFTs, you may even want to store the image offline. Why would you do this? Let&#x27;s say each of the online links is broken. As long as you (or anyone else) has a copy of the image, you can upload it and add a new link to the NFT. As long as the image&#x27;s hash matches the hash that&#x27;s built into the NFT, the new image is guaranteed to be identical to the original, and therefore valid. It is for these reasons that we believe NFTs on Chia will have stronger permanence than on any other blockchain.</p><p>The same rules apply for the metadata and license information. They can exist in multiple locations, but their hashes may not be modified after the initial minting. This prevents future owners from modifying this information, even though they can add new links.</p><p>The metadata URI can provide a wide variety of information about the NFT, including its title, properties (eg - year created, attributes, colors used, etc), rankings (eg - power: 25 out of 100, etc), collection name, as well as series number (eg - 1 of 100). The NFT&#x27;s minter is free to include whatever information they want at the time of minting. The NFT1 spec allows different metadata formats to be developed. At the time of this writing, almost all NFTs use <a href="https://github.com/Chia-Network/chips/blob/main/CHIPs/chip-0007.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CHIP-7</a>, which allows marketplaces to parse the metadata more easily.</p><p>The license URI can provide any relevant information concerning the NFT&#x27;s license, such as who owns the Intellectual Property.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="can-i-add-new-links">Can I add new links?<a href="#can-i-add-new-links" class="hash-link" aria-label="Can I add new links?的直接链接" title="Can I add new links?的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>You can add new URIs to the data, metadata and license URI lists of any NFT you own.

However, because the links are contained within the NFT, as you add links, the size of the NFT also grows. If you were to add thousands of links, the NFT would eventually grow so large, it wouldn&#x27;t fit inside a block and would no longer be spendable. If you only wanted to add a few dozen links, you would not run into this limitation.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="are-all-the-links-posted-on-every-spend-or-only-when-adding-them">Are all the links posted on every spend, or only when adding them?<a href="#are-all-the-links-posted-on-every-spend-or-only-when-adding-them" class="hash-link" aria-label="Are all the links posted on every spend, or only when adding them?的直接链接" title="Are all the links posted on every spend, or only when adding them?的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>On Chia&#x27;s blockchain, everything is a coin.

As long as your NFT makes it into a block, it will take the same amount of time as any other transaction to process. The only caveat is that NFTs have a higher CLVM cost than XCH transactions. Therefore, if the mempool is full, a higher fee will be required in order for an NFT to be included in a block. However, if the mempool is not full, then this caveat does not apply.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-much-is-the-fee-for-mintingselling-an-nft">How much is the fee for minting/selling an NFT?<a href="#how-much-is-the-fee-for-mintingselling-an-nft" class="hash-link" aria-label="How much is the fee for minting/selling an NFT?的直接链接" title="How much is the fee for minting/selling an NFT?的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>If the mempool is not full, then no fee is needed.

After the NFT has been minted, the royalty may never be modified. If an NFT includes a royalty, then every time the NFT is sold, the appropriate percentage of the sale will be paid to the royalty&#x27;s receive address (typically the address of the original artist). The amount paid both to the new owner, as well as the royalty address, will be clearly displayed within the Offer.</p><p>On other blockchains, royalties are paid at the discretion of the marketplace on which the NFT is custodied. On Chia, however, the royalties are built directly into the NFT. While under-the-table transfers could still circumvent royalties, they would also introduce counterparty risk for both the buyer and seller. In order to transfer a Chia NFT in a trustless manner, royalties must be paid.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="are-there-any-royalties-when-exchanging-an-nft-for-another-nft">Are there any royalties when exchanging an NFT for another NFT?<a href="#are-there-any-royalties-when-exchanging-an-nft-for-another-nft" class="hash-link" aria-label="Are there any royalties when exchanging an NFT for another NFT?的直接链接" title="Are there any royalties when exchanging an NFT for another NFT?的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>No -- there would be no fair way to assess royalties for NFT-for-NFT offers, so these are treated as swaps with no royalties being calculated.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-are-royalties-calculated-in-offers-that-involve-multiple-assets">How are royalties calculated in offers that involve multiple assets?<a href="#how-are-royalties-calculated-in-offers-that-involve-multiple-assets" class="hash-link" aria-label="How are royalties calculated in offers that involve multiple assets?的直接链接" title="How are royalties calculated in offers that involve multiple assets?的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>This depends on what assets are included in the offer. A few rules to keep in mind:</p><ol><li>If more than one NFT is being traded, the royalties will be divided by the number of NFTs. For example:<ul><li>If 4 NFTs are being traded for 1 XCH, then each NFT will have an assumed price of 0.25 XCH<ul><li>If the royalty for each NFT is 10%, then each NFT will receive a 0.025 XCH royalty, for a total royalty of 0.1</li><li>If the royalties are 10%, 8%, 5%, and 3%, then the NFTs will receive 0.025 XCH, 0.02 XCH, 0.0125 XCH, and 0.0075 XCH, for a total royalty of 0.65 XCH</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>If the NFTs are being traded for more than one fungible asset, then the royalties will be calculated for each asset individually<ul><li>For example, if 1 NFT is being traded for both 1 XCH and 1000 SBX and it carries a 10% royalty, then the royalties shall be 0.1 XCH and 100 SBX for this sale</li></ul></li><li>If multiple NFTs are being traded for multiple fungible assets, then rules 1. and 2. will both be applied</li><li>When NFTs are traded for other NFTs, no royalties are exchanged</li></ol><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="can-i-use-more-than-one-royalty-address">Can I use more than one royalty address?<a href="#can-i-use-more-than-one-royalty-address" class="hash-link" aria-label="Can I use more than one royalty address?的直接链接" title="Can I use more than one royalty address?的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>An NFT can include a maximum of one royalty address.
